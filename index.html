<h2>
Origin Story 2
</h2>

<p>
Yo, Neon's tale ain't your typical street saga, but let me drop you into the world where he ain't choose the streets—the streets chose him.
In the concrete jungle of his mind, Neon's game wasn't dealing cards on the corner but slinging concepts in the wild world of design. Coming straight outta the Eastern Washington blocks, he swapped out gang signs for graphic signs and dice rolls for code.
One day, Neon's advisor dropped the class bomb on him, talkin' 'bout merging the hustle of AI with the finesse of design. This ain't no ordinary grind—it's the hoodrat hustle in the tech game.

With a love for Minecraft modpacks thicker than a summer haze, Neon dreamed of games with more hooks than a fisherman's tackle box. Picture this: movement shooters with grappling hooks, XCOM vibes, and a Slime theme that’s slicker than a getaway car.
But the streets ain't always paved with gold; sometimes, it's more like cracked asphalt and broken dreams. Neon felt the struggle, stuck in a maze of possibilities, wondering if he'd ever catch a break.
In the hoodrat code, time ain't a luxury; it's a ticking bomb. Neon knew he couldn't roll the dice forever, chasing every dream. So, he cooked up a Confucian-style game plan – start small, prototype, and finesse it like a street artist with a spray can.
In the game of life, Neon wasn't dealin' with street corners; he was navigating the corners of creativity, crafting his own narrative from the concrete he was given. It ain't about the streets he didn't choose; it's about making the most of the thug life in the hustle of pixels, code, and dreams. Neon ain't just gaming; he's surviving and thriving in the hoodrat realms of creativity.
